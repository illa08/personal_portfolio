    <h2 style="font-family: 'The Girl Next Door', cursive; font-size:xxx-large;">My Tech Journey</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">My journey began in middle school when the whole class went to the computer lab for the first time and we 
      were told that we can create our own website just by typing '!' and pressing enter, we did exactly what we 
      were told not having a single knowledge about the words that appeared and everyone wrote an essay about 
      themselves but it was like magic for us that we could do such a thing and hence began my journey for curiosity.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">I started learning Python as my first programming language in my high school and printed my very first
       'Hello World'. The initial learning phase was a bit struggling but I finally understood the basics and 
         built a rock, paper and scissor game.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">When I entered college, it was a whole new world to me. There I got introduced to so many new 
        technological terms and tools it got a little overwhelming for me. I started exploring every domain 
        and tried to find something that intrigued me the most:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
       <li>I got started with UI/UX design where I learned how important it is to keep the users in mind while building any project.</li>
       <li>I delve deep into machine learning where I learned how to work with data and build systems that can improve over time.</li>
       <li>Started learning and practicing 'Data Structures and Algorithms' in the Java programming language which helped in enhancing my problem solving skills.</li>
       <li> Now, I'm diving deep into web development and working on personal projects that blend interactivity with storytelling.</li>
      </ul>
